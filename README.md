# Project Title
Diabetes Data Analysis with EDA

# Problem Statement
Diabetes is a significant health concern worldwide, and understanding the factors that contribute to diabetes can help in early diagnosis and prevention. This project aims to analyze diabetes data to identify patterns and relationships among various features, ultimately assisting in better healthcare decisions. We will perform data extraction, cleaning, and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and key metrics.

# Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

# Approach
The main goal of the project is to explore the diabetes dataset, identify key metrics, and illustrate meaningful relationships between different features.

Data Collection: Imported the diabetes dataset using the Pandas library.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and created new features based on initial insights.
Data Preprocessing: Modified the dataset structure to enhance clarity and prepare it for analysis.
Data Analysis: Analyzed the dataset using Pandas and NumPy to derive insights.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate the relationships between features and understand trends.

# Key Metrics and Insights
Visualize the distribution of key features (e.g., Glucose, BMI).
Analyze correlations between attributes.
Identify trends in diabetes outcomes based on various factors.
